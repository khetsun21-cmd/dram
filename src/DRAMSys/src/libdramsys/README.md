## Architecture and Functionality

A UML diagram of the software architecture is presented below; different component implementations are left out for simplicity. More information about the architecture and functionality can be found in the papers [1] [2] [3] and in the introduction video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkC3mYWpQY).
